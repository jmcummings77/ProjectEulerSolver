# ProjectEulerSolver

A simple library for working through the [Project Euler problems](https://projecteuler.net/).

Originally targeting the Project Euler website, so with low/no performance requirements. Later reworked some of them for use on HackerRank, where they need to run in a certain amount of time.

No best practices, code is terrible but mostly works.
